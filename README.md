# Forecasting-Time-Series

# 1. Modeling Coca-Cola's quarterly's earnings
In this project, I develop linear time series models using the Box-Jenkins methodology, for the quarterly earnings per share of Coca-Cola. 
I built 5 models in total and compared them in terms of forecasting using both the Recursive Scheme and the Rolling Scheme. 

The R code and detailed report of the analysis as well as the data used for this project can be found in the folder 1_Coca_Cola_Earnings. 

# 2. Modeling monthly mean CO2 mole fraction at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii
In this project, I used the Box-Jenkins methodology to find two time-series models analyze monthly mean CO2 mole fraction at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, with 732 records from March 1958 until February 2019.

The R code and detailed report of the analysis as well as the data used for this project can be found in the folder 2_CO2_Hawaii.
